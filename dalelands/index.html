        <h2>Shadows Over Dale</h2>
        <p>This is Faerun: a world of incredible beauty, sprawling wonder, mystical heritage, and in some places... <strong>ages old evil</strong>.</p>
        <p>The free peoples of Faerun push back at the unbridled wilds with cities and culture, while the unknown shadows of fallen ruins and endless caverns fill the belly of these lands with a promise of danger and glory.</p>
        <p>The gods take active interest in the shaping of the world through their worshippers, while the pursuit of arcane potential ever brings closer an age of renewed prosperity or destruction.</p>
        <p>This is the world in which you live and our adventure begins with the place you all currently call home; nestled between the Thunder Peaks and the forests and rivers of The Dalelands lies the previously sleepy town of Highmoon, protected and ruled by the Baron Crispian Dale.</p>

        <h2>Sentinel of Peril</h2>
        <p>You have been recruited to rescue the Baron's children, who have been abducted by a raid by goblins. You tracked the goblin raiders to their hideout; the ancestral tomb of the noble family. Inside the tomb you discovered a secret entrance to a lower level hidden under the statue of a soldier. You followed the spiral staircase downward, where you fought a gargoyle, avoided a potentially trapped treasure chest and some manner of screeching, skittering creatures which you chose not to face, and instead ran away.</p>
        <h2>Blessings and Bad Luck</h2>
        <p>Returning to the main hall of the tomb, you follow the goblin tracks to confront them in a room containing an enchanted fountain, chasing the last survivor further into the tomb where Trogdof fell into a pit trap. After helping Trogdof out of the trap, you attempted to sneak into the room where the children were being kept, not realizing that your foes had already become aware of your presence. After Willow was wounded to unconsciousness in the following battle, Garin's rage, Cor's insults, and Trogof's critical execution of a Magic Missle made short work of your foes and allowed you to free the children and leave a single hobgoblin caged in the tomb.</p>
        <p>You return to the city of Highmoon, the Baron's children resting in Cor's wagon with the heavily wounded but stable ranger.</p>
        <h2>For Love Of Money</h2>
        <p>Your expedient and successful return to Highmoon is greeted by cheering townsfolk, an awed Captain Damon Velhok of the Baron's Guard, and a grateful Baron and Baronness. The cheers and applause of the townspeople follow you through the town to the Manor, where the Baron and Baronness greet you graciously but briefly before ushering the children back in to the Manor, after which the Baron's (colorful) secretary grants you your reward, relays the Baron's order / invitation to a debriefing the next morning, and introduces you to a cleric, Fezzik, who has some sort of awkward past with Garin. Your business concluded and at your requests for a hot bath, a good meal, and a good night's sleep, Fezzik leads you to the Oak &amp; Spear Tavern, where you are greeted as heroes, and gain your requests.</p>

        <p>The next morning, after Trogdof awakes in his plate of mashed-potatoes to find his purse stolen, you are greeted by your new cleric friend, and, before heading to the Manor, you decide to do some shopping first. The barman recommends Hanseld's Emporium, to which Fezzik leads you, whereupon you find the proprietor Hanseld Silverglean and his second confronted by three thugs, all of whom supposedly work for Hanseld's competition, who he later names as Kessia Andelmaus. After the party fells one of the bandits and immobilizes the second, the third makes his escape to alert his employer. You do a bit of shopping, after which Hanseld reveals his knowledge of your impending appointment with the Baron and negotiates with you for the inclusion of his second, Ellery Shadolaff, in the meeting, who none of you realize has been following you since your return to town.</p>

        <h2>Following A Darker Path</h2>
        <p>As you leave Hanseld's Emporium, now with two new party members, your newly befriended cleric stumbles, freezes, and convulses momentarily. When he recovers, he takes off running down a side street. Fed up and looking for a confrontation with this cowardly exile, Garin tells the others to go to the debriefing without them, and takes off running after Fezzik.</p>
        <p>The rest of the party, mildly confused, decides to head to the Manor, taking your time to take in some of the sights of the city now that you can see it in the daylight. You stroll throught the business laden main street of the city, then wanders up the more affluent district of town. After proper introductions by the Baron with his wife the Baroness Azani, his sister the Countess Carolinia, sovreign of Arabel, the Countess' spouse Dr. Zana Haranthi, and a Professor Charles Harcourt of the House Of Knowledge And Invention (who then left abruptly before the meeting), the Baron explained to all of you (sans dwarves) that, while the goblins had made their way out of the manor and city by very direct and public routes, killing a number of guards in the process, they had somehow managed to distract the guards in such a way that left the main western gate completely abandoned, allowing them to escape. Moreover, while their exit had been public, there was no trace of how they had managed to get into the city, the manor, or the childrens' room in the first place.</p>

After Trogdof failed to cast Light and instead turned himself phosphorescent blue, you followed the tracks to the ground floor, found another secret panel under the stairwell leading to the boiler room, and yet another secret door leading down into the sewers underneath the city.</p>

Arriving in the main sewer, you make your way along a river of foul defilement. The goblin tracks lead you to a T-junction joined by a rope which the goblins must have used to cross, and having made some different struggling attempts to cross, you now find yourselves divided by this intersection, on seperate corners, and two of you doused in grime and feculence...</p>
        <h2>Hot On The Trail</h2>
        <p>After stepping out of Hanseld's Emporium, Fezzik's vision goes white. He sees the reflection of Captain Damon as the Captain looks in a mirror in a common area of the Watchmen's barracks. When the Captain turns away from the mirror to look back at Fezzik, it is no longer the Captain, but one of the other watchmen; Lt. Kavrik Gaines. The Leutenant turns back to the mirror, and the face is once again that of the Captain's, only slightly distorted, with the eyes turning a sickly yellow and beginning to glow. As the glow engulfs Fezzik's vision and turns white, Fezzik's vision clears, he is overtaken by a sense of urgency, and he takes off running to his temple, seeking clues to the vision's meaning, with Garin following hard upon.</p>
        <p>The dwarves arrive at the Temple Of Moradin to meet with Keeper Arnak Kovak, who advises them that the vision indicates some sort of either danger or subterfuge around the Captain and the Leutenant. Not knowing the location of the Leutenant, but knowing that the Captain is supposed to be at the debriefing, the dwarves decide to head to the Manor. Arriving there, they find the meeting disolved, the different parties all attending to different issues having to do with the discovery of the secret passageways, and no sign of the Captain. The dwarves decide to journey into the sewers and attempt to catch up to the rest of the party. Eventually seeing the glowing Trogdof in the distance, and after yet another awkward attempt to cross the T-junction, the dwarves are reunited with the party.</p>

        <p>Now reunited, the six of you continue to follow the goblin tracks through the sewer. After meandering through a couple more twists and turns, you discover a small outcropping where you find a dead body dressed in the clothing of the watchmen. Upon further inspection, you find that it is the body of Captain Damon, along with a pair of goblin tracks leading from the body to the rest of the tracks, and two pairs of human tracks leading to the body from another direction. After some debate, your party decides to continue to follow the goblin tracks with the expectation of finding an exit, Garin taking the Captain's body with you.</p>
        <p>You find an exit from the sewers in the form of a broken wall that leads to a cavern, down which you come upon a swarm of rats and a pair of giant rats (of which you make short work). You follow the cavern to a four-way fork: down the far-left tunnel is a faint sound of a lot of conversations all happening at once; down the near-left tunnel is the smell of dead fish and river; the near-right tunnel is dark and quiet; the far-right tunnel has a breeze, smells of forest, and is where the goblin tracks lead. After some discussion among the party, you decide to continue to follow the tracks. You emerge from the tunnel in a small forest just on the other side of the city walls, and just to the north of "The Braving Grounds"; an area used by the city guards for training. A trail leads up the hill from the braving grounds to the section of the city wall into which the guards barracks has been built.</p>
        <p>Upon seeing the braving grounds and the barracks, the party decides to wait at the edge of the forrest for Fezzik to attempt to chat with some of the other guards and attempt to discern if any of them might be someone other than who they say they are. After striking out at the braving grounds, Fezzik heads up to the barracks to continue his investigation (being shortly after lunch, with most of the on-duty guards having headed back for their shifts, the grounds and barracks are fairly empty). In the commissary of the barracks, Fezzik finds a single table of five guardsmen (two of whom are known to him; Piper Rixi, a halfling fighter, and Lantheon Vaazrus, a brass dragonborn monk), taking a bit longer lunch. His attempts to bait a spy are now successful, and he casts "Sacred Flame" to signal the others in the party who are still outside in the woods.</p>

        <h2>Enemies Within The Gates</h2>
        <p>Leaving Ellery to watch over the corpse of the Captain, the rest of the party charges at toward the commissary. Meanwhile, Fezzik, Piper, Lantheon, and the other two guards find themselves confronted with a gradually revealling doppelganger, which seems able to dodge many of their attacks. At his earliest opportunity, one of the other guards charges off to retrieve backup. After a moment, the other non-descript guard shutters, and then transforms into a were-rat, snarling, and armed with two hand-crossbows.</p>

        <p>While Lantheon and Fezzik focused on the doppelganger, the sergeant turns her attention toward the newly revealed lycanthrope. The beast takes two solid shots at the dragonborn monk, the bolts embedding themselves in his abdomen. Willow is the first of the party to arrive on the scene, and manages to embed an arrow in the wererat's eye. The wererat shrugs off the pain as he pulls the arrow from his eye socket, and the eye and socket heal instantaniously.</p>
        <p>The remaining members of the party catch up to the commissary just in time to halt the doppelganger's escape, the others turn their attentions toward the wererat. As Trogdof, Willow and Corellien make short work of the doppelganger, the Watchmens' melee attacks are shrugged off, but Fezzik's divinely empowered strikes seem to do some permanent damage. The tide begins to turn when Lantheon bathes the lycanthrope in dragonfire, which seems to do the most damage. Garin catches up and nearly cleaves the now scorched creatures leg at the knee, knocking it prone and preventing it's escape. As Garin and Piper restrain it, Corellien finds some silverware in the officer's mess to attempt to see if it will wound it. At Trogdof's request, Cor cuts off its ear, its skin boiling and blistering at the touch of the silver, and it passes out from the pain. Corellien searches the body and finds a silver locket containing a green dragon scale.</p>
        <p>The party barely has time to catch their breath as guards charge in to the main entrances to the commissary, weapons at the ready...</p>
        <h2>They Look Like People</h2>
        <p>At the sergeants orders, the guards stand down. You explain to her the nature of your charge and the discoveries of the morning. After the initial shock of learning of her Captain's death and the presense of spies within the city, she works with the party to brainstorm how to gleen who in their presense may not be an ally. After testing all the guards in the room, a few of you return to where you left Ellery with the body, and bring them both to the commissary. The guards have brought you a simple cart in which to place the bodies.</p>
        <p>The party, accompanied by Piper, Lantheon, and the other guards, return to the manor to test and secure the noble family, and attempt to find any other spies. You quickly find the Countess and the doctor with the children in the nursery, and later find the Baroness in the celler, watching over the secret passageways with the other guards. You learn that the Baron and Mr. Quill have gone to the library at the House of Knowledge and Invention to further research the history of the manor and the city so that they may uncover any other secrets that either may hold.</p>
        <p>Bringing the Baroness, the Countess, the doctor, and the children with you to the college, the Baroness leads you into the library. On the outside, the library is a simple 4 story spire, but on the inside, the floor appears to spiral both above and below out to infinity, with 4 quarter-circle glass lifts controlled by counter-weight move from level to level. After asking at the desk, an ancient gnome leads you to the room where the Baron and Sebastian are working over piles and piles of scrolls, papers, and blueprints.</p>

        <p>Upon reuniting the them with the others, you ask them if there is anywhere nearby where they might be isolated to keep themselves safe. The doctor explains to you that she has a boat that might be able to be used for these purposes, as the family is meant to leave "at week's end", and cannot therefore journey much farther than the city walls. Before leaving the college, you decide you should have a stronger magic user as well as a stronger cleric to assist in warding the family. After some questioning of Professor Harcourt's intentions by Willow, the Baron explains that Charles was under Crispian's orders, but that he doesn't know where he is currently. However, Ellery explains that the professor is taking tea with his employer. Ellery, Lantheon and Trogdof leave for Hanseld's to retrieve them both.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Cor, Willow, and Fezzik go to the Temple of Oghma to find and enlist a cleric. Upon entering the temple, they find it less like a religious service, and more like a music festival, surrounded by dozens of small bands of bard-clerics and bard-paladins all playing various instruments or singing or telling stories or dancing. The three are greeted by the keeper of the temple, a female blue dragonborn of colorful disposition, who introduces them to her second, a young female flute-playing gnome...</p>
        <h2>Blood and Silver</h2>
        <p>The Baron and Mr. Quill, in the company of Garin return to the library to arrange for carriages to transport the party. The librarian uses a "Gate key", which allows any door to open to any other door, to lead them instantaniously to the stables in the Manor, then uses a similar spell to open the stable doors out onto the road just outside the library. The rest of the family climb into the two carriages, and the guards take patrol while awaiting the party.</p>
        <p>The Keeper of the Temple of Oghma introduces herself as Z'dran Ambershard, and introduces the flute-playing gnome as Kayla Windstriker.  Kayla agrees to go with you and attend to the needs of the Baron and his family. She leaves the temple with Cor, Willow and Fezzik, and rejoins the Family of Dale outside the library where they have already acquired and arranged themselves in the carriages. The Baron requests they each take specific positions, and the carriages make their way toward the river district just outside the northern gate of the city.</p>
        <p>Trogdof and Lantheon, led by Ellery, shortcut their way back to Hanseld's. They bypass the shop and instead enter a small warehouse next door to find Hanseld and Professor Harcourt taking tea, and being served by the young thug who had been shot in the knee by Willow in the confrontation just that morning, now healed and with a clean change of clothes. Ellery and the others catch Hanseld and Harcourt up on all that has been uncovered since that morning. Hanseld and Harcourt quickly finish their tea and stand, readying to go. Hanseld grabs a satchel from behind the counter, and leads the others through a back door to a private stable where his carriage awaits. The five of them head towards the river district, just catching up to the family's carriages at the guard checkpoint.</p>
        <p>As the carriages approach the river district, you are taken by the sight of a great, vast building, larger than the manor, four stories and nearly 100 yards long, painted pure white with bright red shutters bordering every window, with balconies wrapping every floor intricately woven patterns of wrought iron for railings, with a look-out tower on one end, and a millwheel on the other. As the carriages pull up to the building, you realize that the building is actually <i>on the river</i>. Disembarking from the carriages, Dr. Haranthi steps out front and turns to face the entire entourage, presenting to the nobel family of Dale the "River Queen", her gift to the King to present to Prince Atherton upon their arrival in Selgaunt in three weeks time.</p>
        <p>While Piper, Lantheon and the other guards escort the family into the grand hall at the front of the ship and begin rounding up the staff and crew for inspection, the party, now reunited, prepares to interrogate the barely-alive wererat. At the party's request, Professor Harcourt attempts to read the wererat's mind. As he does, his eyes flash with blue arcane energy for a moment, then his eyes and Cor's flash with green arcane energy while the wererat's body is consumed with green flame. Corellien and Harcourt share a vision of a pair of yellow eyes surrounded by green scales, a deep raspy laugh, and a sickening odor. Both are briefly taken ill as Corellien throws the locket he uncovered from the wererat on the ground. Harcourt takes a second look at it, having the same vision yet again. Corellien takes the locket back from Harcourt and throws it in the river. Harcourt then explains that it must have been some sort of scrying focus, being used obviously by a green dragon of some extensive magical ability. Without any way to make further use of the information, the party boards the ship to rejoin the family and join in the process of vetting the ship's staff and crew.</p>

        <p>Once aboard, the party assists in the vetting, checking the color of each person's blood and their susceptibility to silver. After vetting the crew and staff present, the guards keep the them all in the main hall while you search through every room on the ship, finding nothing. With the ship cleared, you rejoin the others in the dining hall. With little time left in the day, you attempt to run down some leads as to where any other dopplegangers may be hiding, traversing the city, rechecking the barracks, the manor and the trail between, to no avail. With the day ending and the trail cold, you return to the ship for some welcome hospitality and a night's rest.</p>
        <p>The next morning, you set out to return to the crypt where you left a single hobgoblin alive (sans one ear), to interrogate him. While you are gone, the seargent and the rest of the guard plan to slowly vet other guards, crew and staff from the barracks and the manor who have not yet been brought on board the ship. A brisk walk later and you all arrive at the crypt. You head back down into the crypt, briefly revisiting the fountain on your way to the throne room. When you arrive there, you find the hobgoblin dead, his throat slit...</p>
        <h2>A Test Of Honor</h2>
        <p>No prisoner, no clues, and only questions, Corellien resolves to solve the riddle of the throne room. After much discussion, and a few attempts, Garin finds that, as he kneels before the throne and swears his fealty to the family of Dale, the dias and the throne upon it slides to the side, revealing a door. Ellery, Trogdof and Garin take the lead down the hallway, where Ellery finds a series of floor tiles seem to be pressure-triggers for a poison gas trap.  You all make your way carefully down the hallway, avoiding the trigger tiles, and towards the door at the other end.</p>
        <p>As the party enters the room, a stone slab drops into place, completely blocking the door. Arcane crystal wall sconces begin to light, revealing a large room containing 7 sarcophagi, the last being guarded by the statue of a large bird of prey (a falcon or eagle). The statue begins to glow blue, and then the glow separates itself from the statue, then reformes into a 7' tall humanoid figure, still translucent, with feathered wings, blue skin, long silver hair, simple robes, golden weapons and armor, and a blank expression. One by one, he challenges your honor, daring you to prove yourselves. As he does this, each of the other six sarcophagi are opened from the inside by the newly animated armored skeletons, each of whom wields a different special weapon or item. The battle with the skeletons is challenging, but you are ultimately triumphant, as the skeletons crumble beneath your fists, blades, and Trogdof's "Worldstar!"</p>

        <p>You turn back toward the blue man, and see that, while he remains translucent, his form begins to shift again. His form shrinks by a head, his skin turns pinkish, his robes turn blue and grow longer, his armor turns gray, and the rest of his clothes shift and change around him. He smiles amiably at each of you, and speaks nervously. He introduces himself as the astral form of Kael Vardon, one of the legendary Seven, the heroes of the Land of Dale who drove out the Zhentarim two centuries past. As he speaks, he turns to the sarcophagus behind his form and waves his hand. The lid splits open in the middle, each end slides as they open, and an old, old cittern levitates up out of the sarcophagus and into Kael's ethereal hands. He explains that this is one of the seven Instruments of the Bards, which were what the Seven had used in their ultimate victory over the Zhentarim. "This is the MacFuirmidh Cittern," he says, " and it is now entrusted to you." He also explains that the other Instruments of the Bards have been hidden throughout the Land of Dale, and will be needed for the challenge that you yet face. Realizing that he has just given away more information than he should have, he quickly bids you farewell and good luck, and vanishes with a twinkle. As he does, the stone barrier blocking the door retracts, and the door opens.</p>

        <p>You look over the piles of dust where the skeletons once stood, and find that each of their distinct weapons or items are still intact. You are able to recover the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><i>A Daggar of Warning</i></b>, which prevents the wielder and his allies from being attacked in surprise.</li>
          <li><b><i>A Sentinel Shield</i></b>, which enhances the wielder's perception.</li>
          <li><b><i>A Tan Bag of Tricks</i></b>, which allows the user to create up to three random animal allies per day.</li>
          <li><b><i>A Quiver of Ehlonna</i></b>, which allows the wearer to carry a vast array of long weapons and ammunition.</li>
          <li><b><i>A Cloak of Elvenkind</i></b>, which grants the wearer enhanced stealth.</li>
          <li><b><i>A pair of Boots of Striding and Springing</i></b>, which grants the wearer enhanced speed and jumping distance.</li>
