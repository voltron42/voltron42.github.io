        <h3>Shadows Over Dale</h3>
        <p>This is Faerun: a world of incredible beauty, sprawling wonder, mystical heritage, and in some places... <strong>ages old evil</strong>.</p>
        <p>The free peoples of Faerun push back at the unbridled wilds with cities and culture, while the unknown shadows of fallen ruins and endless caverns fill the belly of these lands with a promise of danger and glory.</p>
        <p>The gods take active interest in the shaping of the world through their worshippers, while the pursuit of arcane potential ever brings closer an age of renewed prosperity or destruction.</p>
        <p>This is the world in which you live and our adventure begins with the place you all currently call home; nestled between the Thunder Peaks and the forests and rivers of The Dalelands lies the previously sleepy town of Highmoon, protected and ruled by the Baron Crispian Dale.</p>

        <h3>Sentinel of Peril</h3>
        <p>You have been recruited to rescue the Baron's children, who have been abducted by a raid by goblins. You tracked the goblin raiders to their hideout; the ancestral tomb of the noble family. Inside the tomb you discovered a secret entrance to a lower level hidden under the statue of a soldier. You followed the spiral staircase downward, where you fought a gargoyle, avoided a potentially trapped treasure chest and some manner of screeching, skittering creatures which you chose not to face, and instead ran away.</p>
        <h3>Blessings and Bad Luck</h3>
        <p>Returning to the main hall of the tomb, you follow the goblin tracks to confront them in a room containing an enchanted fountain, chasing the last survivor further into the tomb where Trogdof fell into a pit trap. After helping Trogdof out of the trap, you attempted to sneak into the room where the children were being kept, not realizing that your foes had already become aware of your presence. After Willow was wounded to unconsciousness in the following battle, Garin's rage, Cor's insults, and Trogof's critical execution of a Magic Missle made short work of your foes and allowed you to free the children and leave a single hobgoblin caged in the tomb.</p>
        <p>You return to the city of Highmoon, the Baron's children resting in Cor's wagon with the heavily wounded but stable ranger.</p>
        <h3>For Love Of Money</h3>
        <p>Your expedient and successful return to Highmoon is greeted by cheering townsfolk, an awed Captain Damon Velhok of the Baron's Guard, and a grateful Baron and Baronness. The cheers and applause of the townspeople follow you through the town to the Manor, where the Baron and Baronness greet you graciously but briefly before ushering the children back in to the Manor, after which the Baron's (colorful) secretary grants you your reward, relays the Baron's order / invitation to a debriefing the next morning, and introduces you to a cleric, Fezzik, who has some sort of awkward past with Garin. Your business concluded and at your requests for a hot bath, a good meal, and a good night's sleep, Fezzik leads you to the Oak &amp; Spear Tavern, where you are greeted as heroes, and gain your requests.</p>

        <p>The next morning, after Trogdof awakes in his plate of mashed-potatoes to find his purse stolen, you are greeted by your new cleric friend, and, before heading to the Manor, you decide to do some shopping first. The barman recommends Hanseld's Emporium, to which Fezzik leads you, whereupon you find the proprietor Hanseld Silverglean and his second confronted by three thugs, all of whom supposedly work for Hanseld's competition, who he later names as Kessia Andelmaus. After the party fells one of the bandits and immobilizes the second, the third makes his escape to alert his employer. You do a bit of shopping, after which Hanseld reveals his knowledge of your impending appointment with the Baron and negotiates with you for the inclusion of his second, Ellery Shadolaff, in the meeting, who none of you realize has been following you since your return to town.</p>

        <h3>Following A Darker Path</h3>
        <p>As you leave Hanseld's Emporium, now with two new party members, your newly befriended cleric stumbles, freezes, and convulses momentarily. When he recovers, he takes off running down a side street. Fed up and looking for a confrontation with this cowardly exile, Garin tells the others to go to the debriefing without them, and takes off running after Fezzik.</p>
        <p>The rest of the party, mildly confused, decides to head to the Manor, taking your time to take in some of the sights of the city now that you can see it in the daylight. You stroll throught the business laden main street of the city, then wanders up the more affluent district of town. After proper introductions by the Baron with his wife the Baroness Azani, his sister the Countess Carolinia, sovreign of Arabel, the Countess' spouse Dr. Zana Haranthi, and a Professor Charles Harcourt of the House Of Knowledge And Invention (who then left abruptly before the meeting), the Baron explained to all of you (sans dwarves) that, while the goblins had made their way out of the manor and city by very direct and public routes, killing a number of guards in the process, they had somehow managed to distract the guards in such a way that left the main western gate completely abandoned, allowing them to escape. Moreover, while their exit had been public, there was no trace of how they had managed to get into the city, the manor, or the childrens' room in the first place.</p>

After Trogdof failed to cast Light and instead turned himself phosphorescent blue, you followed the tracks to the ground floor, found another secret panel under the stairwell leading to the boiler room, and yet another secret door leading down into the sewers underneath the city.</p>

The goblin tracks lead you to a T-junction joined by a rope which the goblins must have used to cross, and having made some different struggling attempts to cross, you now find yourselves divided by this intersection, on seperate corners, and two of you doused in grime and feculence...
