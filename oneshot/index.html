        <h2>D &amp; D One-Shot</h2>
        <p>This is Faerun: a world of incredible beauty, sprawling wonder, mystical heritage, and in some places... <strong>ages old evil</strong>.</p>
        <p>The free peoples of Faerun push back at the unbridled wqileds with cities and culture, while the unknown shadows of fallen ruins and endless caverns fill the belly of these lands with a promis of danger and glory.</p>
        <p>The Gods take active interest in the shaping of the world through their worshippers, while the pursuit of arcane potential ever brings closer an age of renewed prosperity or destruction.</p>
        <p>This is the world in which you live and our adventure begins with the place you all currently call home; nestled between the Thunder Peaks and the forests and rivers of The Dalelands lies the previously sleepy town of Highmoon, protected and ruled by Baron Crispian Dale.</p>
        <p>You have been recruited to rescue the Baron's children, who have been abducted by a raid by goblins.</p>
        <p>You tracked the goblin raiders to their hideout; the ancestral tomb of the noble family.</p>
        <p>Inside the tomb you discovered a secret lower level where you fought a gargoyle, avoided a potentially trapped treasure chest and some manner of screeching, skittering creatures which you did not face.</p>
        <p>Returning to the main hall of the tomb, you follow the goblin tracks to confront them in a room containing an enchanted fountain, chasing the last survivor further into the tomb where Trogdof fell into a pit trap. After helping Trogdof out of the trap, you attempted to sneak into the room where the children were being kept, not realizing that your foes had already become aware of your presence. After Willow was wounded to unconsciousness in the following battle, Garin's rage, Cor's insults, and Trogof's critical execution of a Magic Missle made short work of your foes and allowed you to free the children and leave a single hobgoblin caged in the tomb.</p>
        <p>You now approach the edge of the city of Highmoon, the Baron's children resting in Cor's wagon with the heavily wounded but stable ranger. Awaiting you are a potentially grateful Baron and Baroness, as well as a number of unanswered questions...</p>
