    <div class="summary">
      <p>This is Faerun: a world of incredible beauty, sprawling wonder, mystical heritage, and in some places... <strong>ages old evil</strong>.</p>
      <p>The free peoples of Faerun push back at the unbridled wqileds with cities and culture, while the unknown shadows of fallen ruins and endless caverns fill the belly of these lands with a promis of danger and glory.</p>
      <p>The Gods take active interest in the shaping of the world through their worshippers, while the pursuit of arcane potential ever brings closer an age of renewed prosperity or destruction.</p>
      <p>This is the world in which you live and our adventure begins with the place you all currently call home; nestled between the Thunder Peaks and the forests and rivers of The Dalelands lies the previously sleepy town of Highmoon, protected and ruled by Baron Crispian Dale.</p>
      <p>You have been recruited to rescue the Baron's children, who have been abducted by a raid by goblins.</p>
      <p>You've tracked the goblin raiders to their hideout; the ancestral tomb of the noble family. Within lies a host of monsters, and the children they kidnapped to use in their vile scheme. If you hurry, they may still be alive...</p>
